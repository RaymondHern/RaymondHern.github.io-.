### CPSC 120
lab 1
  
  Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it was our frist lab in this class and me and my partner really clicked together. I think wat i liked the most was the fact that the instructions were easy to follow and at times it did present a challenge because we didn't know some of the terms however we were able to understand everything and were on of the groups who finished in the class period.
lab 4

    Lab 4 is another one of my favorite labs because we got to deal with coding measurements. There were a couple of challenges like making sure we had the right variable but oveall with the lab insructures help we were able to get and seening the conversions of the measurements was felt like we had did some magic.
lab 8
    Finally Lab 8 was another lab that I loved doing because in the first part of the lab we got to combine a little bit of math with coding which I thought was cool and fel like it was some real world experice. In the second part of the lab we had the chance to create a patern and while I found it ticky it was still a lot of fun coding it.
